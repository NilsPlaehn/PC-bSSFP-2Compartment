# PC-bSSFP-2Compartment
Simulation code for the describtion of PC-bSSFP signal profiles of two-compartment systems for different sign conventions 

This MATLAB code can be used for the simulation of PC-bSSFP profiles in two-compartment (singlet) systems. 
Originally the code was develope for objective falsification of opposite and aligned phase sign models 
in two-compartment systems.
A prelimiary manuscript can be found on ArXiV https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12548 
This manuscript will be restructured if it gets accepted for publication I will update the link to the 
new version. 
Parameters and literature references are includes and explainations are provides within the code.

If you have questions or comments on the code or on the theory you can contact me via:
