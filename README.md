# PC-bSSFP-2Compartment
Simulation code for the description of PC-bSSFP signal profiles of two-compartment systems for different sign conventions 

This MATLAB code can be used for the simulation of PC-bSSFP profiles in two-compartment (singlet) systems. 
Originally the code was developed for objective falsification of opposite and aligned phase sign models in two-compartment systems.
A preliminary manuscript can be found on ArXiV https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12548 .
This manuscript currently gets restructured and if it gets accepted for publication, I will update the link to the 
new published version. 
Parameters and literature references are included, and explanations are provided within the code
